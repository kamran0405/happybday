      <p>Dear Yusra Api,</p>
      <p>
        Through every high and low, you’ve been right there — guiding me,
        lifting me up, and reminding me I’m stronger than I think. I’m so
        blessed to have you not just as my sister, but as my best friend.
      </p>
      <p>
        On your birthday, I want you to know that I see all the sacrifices
        you’ve made for me, and I will never forget them. You’re my hero, my
        inspiration, and the reason I keep pushing forward.
      </p>
      <p>Happy Birthday, Api. I love you more than words can say. 💖</p>
      <p>Your forever grateful sibling, ❤️ [Your Name]</p>
